#----------------------------------------------------------------
# PREPROC TO DO:
#----------------------------------------------------------------
# 01) Check if files are already organized into the current
#    directory structure format or if 4dfp files already exist, 
#    to avoid redundant processing
# 02) Add option for selective processing (i.e., just convert)
# 03) Test speed differences between dcmdump and medcon for 
#    reading files. Can dcmtk convert to anz? Don't want to 
#    add more dependencies...
# 04) Add in output of movement data file compatible with
#    plot_movt.sh to QA/ directory.
# 05) Add in option for gzip compression/decompression of raw
#    data.
# 06) Add option for varying degrees of verbosity
# 08) Move $econ checks and cleanup to a case statement at the
#    end of the script. Makes more sense, instead of checking
#    the econ setting all over the script.
# 09) Add in better support for multiple mprages and T2s
# 10) Subject readme/summary file output to QA/
# 11) QA checks (snr, movt, variance overlay) to QA/
# 12) Support for multiple atlas t4 file output
# 13) Support for single subj cross-day/multi-session processing
